"Build a modern, multi-step account creation and business details collection web interface just like Zoho Bookings, using Node.js (Next.js preferred for fullstack with React), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The UI components and layout should closely follow these attached screenshots, which represent onboarding forms for business setup:

Pages to implement:

Welcome page to enter business name, website, and select currency.

Industry and business needs selection (multi-choice buttons/chips, reflecting state visually).

Time zone, available times, and available days calendar selection.

Custom labels page: input fields for renaming core system objects (event types, team members) with suggestions and real-time preview panel.

UI/UX requirements:

Responsive design, visually clean and modern, matching the layouts and visual hierarchy seen in the screenshots.

Each step should have a progress indicator and supportive side panel as shown.

Use Tailwind CSS for all styling, keep components accessible, and match the colors/fonts typical of a B2B SaaS product.

Use React with TypeScript for form logic and validation.

Components must be reusable where possible (e.g., for form fields, button chips, previews).

Add back/next navigation between steps; final step has a 'Create' button.

Pre-populate fields with example placeholders as seen in the images.

Entire onboarding logic (UI + minimal backend API) should be covered in TypeScript.

Data flow:

Manage form state with React Context or a state management solution.

Simulate or implement backend API endpoints with Node.js and TypeScript for collecting/submitting data (business, preferences, times, labels).

Features to include:

Real-time preview for custom labels step.

Validation for required fields and formatting (e.g., URL, email).

Stepper/progress bar updating as user advances through signup.

Modularized folder structure for 'pages', 'components', 'api', and 'styles'.

Example test data for industries, business needs, time zones, and currencies.

Technologies: Node.js, Next.js or Express, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React.
